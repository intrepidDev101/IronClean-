```

For **Red Hat/CentOS-based** systems, run:

```bash
sudo yum install sudo mailx
```

#### Download and Install IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è

./setup.sh
```
---

The `setup.sh` script will:

- Install IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è globally in `/usr/local/bin/`.

```

## How to Use
IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è offers two main modes: **Interactive Mode** and **Basic Usage**.

#### Interactive Mode
IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è allows you to interactively choose which system cleanup operations to perform.

1.Run the program in interactive mode:

```bash
ironcl.sh --interactive
```

2.You will be presented with a simple menu. Use the number keys to choose the task:

- **1**: Install IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è globally
- **2**: Overwrite existing installation
- **3**: Set up email notifications
- **4**: Exit

3.Select the desired action by entering the corresponding number.

#### Basic Usage
In addition to interactive mode, you can execute all cleanup tasks in one go using the default mode.

```bash
ironcl.sh
```

This will:

- Display disk usage analysis.
- Clear memory cache.
- Clean junk files, temporary files, and old software packages.
- Display the disk usage analysis again after cleanup.

## Features in Detail
### Memory Cache Cleaning

IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è clears the memory cache, freeing up RAM without requiring a system reboot. This operation can help improve system performance by removing cached data from unused applications.

**How it works**:

- The script writes to `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` to clear the cache.

## Junk File Cleanup
Junk files include system logs, temporary files, and other unnecessary files that accumulate over time. IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è will clean them to recover disk space and reduce system clutter.

**Types of files cleaned**:

- Cache files
- Log files
- Temporary files from applications

## Temporary File Cleanup
IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è also cleans temporary files from system directories like `/tmp` and `/var/tmp`.

## Old Software Package Cleanup
Old software packages and dependencies that are no longer needed can take up valuable disk space. IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è removes these unnecessary packages to keep your system lean and efficient.

## Disk Usage Analysis
Before and after performing cleanup operations, IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è displays a disk usage analysis. This lets you see exactly how much space was recovered and where it was freed up.

## Email Notifications
IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è can send you email notifications after the cleanup process is complete. You will be prompted to enter your email address during the initial configuration (if not already configured).

# Setup
## Setting Up Email Notifications
During the first run or setup, you will be prompted to enter your email address for receiving notifications about system cleanups.

1.Run the `setup.sh` script, and it will ask for your email address.

2.The email address will be saved in `$HOME/.ironclean.conf`.

3.Ensure the `mail` utility is installed for email notifications.

**Note**: IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è uses the system's default mail program (`mail` or `mailx`). If you don't have one installed, you may need to install `mailutils` or another similar tool depending on your distribution.

## Global Installation with `setup.sh`
To install IronCleanüõ°Ô∏è globally, simply run the `setup.sh` script. This will:

- Copy the `ironcl.sh` script to `/usr/local/bin/`, making it executable globally.
- Set up the necessary configuration files.
- Provide a basic CLI interface for setting options.

To run the setup script:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

# Troubleshooting
- **Permission Denied (when clearing memory cache)**: Ensure you have `sudo` privileges and are running the script with the appropriate permissions. Memory cache cleaning requires root privileges.

- **Email Not Sending**: Make sure the `mail` command is installed and configured correctly on your system. Check the configuration in `$HOME/.ironclean.conf` to ensure your email address is correct.

- **Not Enough Space Recovered**: If IronClean doesn't seem to recover enough space, try running the tool again after a longer period of usage. Old packages and junk files may accumulate over time.
